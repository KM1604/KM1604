### KM Eccles

* I'm currently working in a small (one-person) data department. 
* Focused on SQL, Python, and data management.
* The hardest part isn't the code, it's making good design survive collaborative planning.
* When I look at my old code and think it's trash, I remind myself that just means I've continued to learn.
