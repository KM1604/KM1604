### Trying to organize data is like herding sheep, and sometimes the end users are the wolves.

I'm currently working as a one-man data department, managing the creation of new data collection methods as well as filling a backend data engineer role. Interested in automation and efficiently communicating data to end users that helps drive efficient and wise decisionmaking.

I'm a minimalist at heart. This readme is already too long.
